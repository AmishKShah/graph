This folder contains the AsciiDoc source file used to produce the HTML, XML (DOCBOOK), EPUB, MOBI and PDF output.

**A special note about releases**

Starting with revision 274 (Dec 24 2017), all of the output files (XML, EPUB, MOBI, HTML and PDF) will now be stored using Git releases. Going forward, this should reduce the amount of disk space required for people who create forks of this project. The releases are located [here](https://github.com/krlawrence/graph/releases).

NOTE: In order to prune the unwanted files from the project the commit hostory for the output files had to be removed. If you have previously cloned or forked this project please create a new clone or fork. Sorry for the inconvenience but this will get you back approximately 50% of the disk space that was being taken up and will help anyone else making a clone.

**About the files in this folder**

You can browse the 'Gremlin-Graph-Guide.adoc' file directly from within the GitHub (web interface) and it will work but you will not get the full color coding and other niceties that are present in the HTML and PDF versions as they have been run through an AsciiDoc processor and had various style sheets and code pretty printers applied. Your mileage may vary but I find the HTML version to be the most pleasing to read. The '.adoc' file will always contain the most recent updates. The other formats (HTML,DocBook,PDF,ePub and MOBI) will be generated once there are enough updates to make it worthwhile generating a 'release'. If you want to build the output format files yourself they can be generated by running the 'make-book.sh' script. The script assumes you have Asciidoctor installed (which is a Ruby Gem) as well as Pygments.rb (another Ruby Gem). To do the conversion to MOBI and EPUB the script assumes that Calibre and Pandoc are installed. I have successfuly built the book on several Linux distros including Ubuntu, CentOS and Red Hat. I have successfully used Asciidoctor on Mac OS as well but I always use Linux to produce the EPUB abd MOBI versions.

To read the HTML file please either downloaded it to your computer or visit http://kelvinlawrence.net/book/Gremlin-Graph-Guide.html as it is too big for Git to display inside its web user interface. 

To view the PDF please either download it and use a PDF viewer or visit http://kelvinlawrence.net/book/Gremlin-Graph-Guide.pdf

The XML (DOCBOOK) file is generated using Asciidoctor and can be viewed on Linux using the Yelp tool among many others or used to produce other formats. The EPUB and MOBI files can be viewed using most popular e-book readers and some browsers.

Please note that the DOCBOOK, EPUB and MOBI format files currently do not have all of the nice source code highlighting and colors that the HTML and PDF versions have.
