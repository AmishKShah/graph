Note that files with a ".groovy" extension but with all lowercase names are intended to be launched from within the Gremlin Console. Files with a ".groovy" extenstion and capitalized names, such as TinkerGraphTest.groovy, are stand alone groovy applications that should be run from outside of the console using the groovy runtime.

Files with a ".java" extension are stand alone Java applications that need to be compiled and run using a Java JDK.
