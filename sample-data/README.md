This folder contains the GraphML file for the air-routes graph. This air-routes graph is referenced throughout the book.

Two files are provided. The file *'air-routes.graphml'* contains the full graph containing over 40,000 routes and over 3,300 airports. The file air-routes-small.graphml just has routes between 46 airports all located in the US.

The small script called *'load-air-routes-graph.groovy'* can be used to load the graph into a TinkerGraph from within the Gremlin Console. Edit the script before using it to adjust the location of where you put the GraphML file on your system.

There is also a small Groovy script in the *'sample-code'* folder that can be run from within the Gremlin console to produce some statistics about the graph similr to those found in the boook and in the *'README-air-routes.txt file'*.

Please check back regularly to see more updates as they are uploaded.
